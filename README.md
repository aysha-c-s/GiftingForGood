# Gifting For Good

Gifting For Good is an innovative online platform committed to reducing food 
waste and supporting those in need. Surplus food from events, parties, or 
restaurants can be easily donated, creating connections within the community 
to share this vital resource. By bridging the gap between those wanting to 
reduce food waste and those involved in donating food, including NGOs and 
community organizations, the platform facilitates direct delivery of surplus 
food to recipients for individuals wishing to distribute food themselves. 
Featuring a robust database system to manage user data, donation posts, and 
interactions securely and efficiently, Gifting For Good ensures a smooth 
experience for all users, whether donors or recipients.
